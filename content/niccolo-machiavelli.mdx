This is a short resume of this lecture by [Michael Sugrue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU7hdGKOGyk&ab_channel=MichaelSugrue)

In short, the Machiavellian man desires power above all else, the gratification of his own desires and is a being that lacks a moral compass.

| Politicians can take bribes (if they get any advantage from them) | Politicians shouldn't take bribes (it impedes evolution of society) |
|                    Politicians can kill anyone                    |                  Politicians shouldn't kill anyone                  |
|      Politicians have to master the art of the double-crossing     |        Politicians should work for the betterment of society        |

### Moral Being
The moral man is guided by a **metaphysical representation** of the world (be it some type of god, higher morals), while **Machiavelli** is guided purely by self-satisfaction and the nature of this world. 

Machiavelli thinks we are beasts deep inside, that **rationality** should be subjugated and put to work in order to reach our **irrational desires**.

Machiavellinism creates people that aren't social animals (that's what Sugrue says). 
His argument is that 
1. you wouldn't want Machiavelli to work for you (as a subordinate) because people around you will start dissapearing in his conquest for power.
2. you wouldn't want to work for Machiavelli because you are just a means to and end, a vehicle for his achievement of glory and self-satisfaction

### An example for *2* (a little story) which the Machiavellian man **adores**.

After **the Prince** takes power and conquers a few districts, the people in one of these districts are revolting. There are high crime-rates, hatred for their new conqueror and the society is slowly driving into chaos. 

The Prince appoints one of his men (his second in command) to go there and he tells him to do anything to make these people fearful and if anyone asks why, he should tell them the Prince has told him to do so, and if they ask again **kill them**.

So the second in command does this for a few months. Now the people are scared, yet they are also hateful of the man who is killing their brothers, sisters or parents. So one day, the Prince gets the men he really trusts and kills his second in command in front of the entire district, **apologizing for his behaviour** and **telling everyone he didn't know the way he was acting**.

Machiavelli believes this is a genius move.
